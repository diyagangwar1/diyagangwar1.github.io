        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I'm a builder, tinkerer, and systems thinkerâ€”currently a junior at Harvey Mudd College 
          studying Computer Science with minors in Human-Centered Design and Economics. My work lives 
          at the intersection of AI, hardware, and human intuition: Ive deployed real-time face 
          detection on solar-powered microcontrollers (no batteries, no cloud) and designed NLP-powered
          tools to untangle messy workflows in high-stakes environments. Whether Im optimizing ML
          inference on the edge or prototyping with users in the loop, I care about one thing: building
          resilient, impactful systems that actually work in the wild. Fast-moving teams and bold ideas
          are my favorite kind of chaos.
